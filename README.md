 Lagrange's four-square theorem

 A perfect square is an integer than can be written as the square of another integer. For example:

 • 25 is a perfect square, because it is the square of 5 (i.e., 5² = 25)

 • 64 is a perfect square, because it is the square of 8 (i.e., 8² = 64)

 Lagrange proved that any positive integer can be expressed as the sum of at most 4 positive perfect squares. For example:

 1 = 1
 
 2 = 1 + 1
 
 3 = 1 + 1 + 1
 
 4 = 4
 
 5 = 4 + 1
 
 6 = 4 + 1 + 1
 
 7 = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1
 
 8 = 4 + 4
 
 9 = 9
 
 10 = 9 + 1
 
 11 = 9 + 1 + 1
 
 12 = 9 + 1 + 1 + 1
 
 13 = 9 + 4
 
 14 = 9 + 4 + 1
